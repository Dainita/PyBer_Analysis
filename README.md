# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## Overview 

### Purpose
Create a dataframe from the Pyber ridesharing data by city type, then use Matplotlib to create a graph showing the total monthly fares by city type. This data will be used to perform an analyis of the differences between city types and how Pyber can use the data to make decisions. Recommendations will be offered to help reconcile any disparities across the city types.   

## Analysis

### Ride sharing data by city type
From reviewing the results of the Pyber ride sharing data by city type, several differences can be identified between the city types. However, these differences can all be correlated to each other and used as indicators for increasing opportunities. For example, rural total rides account for the least rides at only 5% of the total rides, but the average fare per ride is the highest among the city types. Urban total rides and total drives account for the majority of rides with the lowest average fare per ride. Suburban rides appear to be most efficient with the highest ratio or total rides to total drivers resulting in a higher average fare per driver. Although rural rides have a higher average fare per rider, that can be contributed to the probability that rural rides are for longer distances than either suburban or urban rides. The denser poputlation in the suburban and urban city types also contribute to the higher number of customers and avaialble drivers.

## Recommendations
Futher analysis of the data by city types by including the mileage for each trip will be beneficial in returning more accurate results. Including the mileage would help to differentiate the effect of the trip distances on the overall total fares and averages. Expanding the date range of the data to include a full year will also help to determine the effects of seasons, holidays, and other significant events.

Evaluate the number of drivers in the rural cities. With the limited drivers, opportunites may be missed to provide customers timely service based on driver availability. Because the rural trips are suspected to be longer, the drivers are occupied longer, therefore additional drivers would provide the advantage of availability.

Invest in marketing to increase the utilization of Pyber's ride sharing program. Marketing is a low risk investment thay usually provides a significant return. Increasing the awareness and popularity of Pyber will benefit all city types by increasing the number of riders and total fares. This increase in awareness may also help to increase the number of drivers they become more aware of the services offered by Pyber.
